Two shell script files to pull electoral results and spit out pipe-separated text files for use in excel or whatever database you want.

sadeifetch.sh pulls html pages to your local machine as new txt files and then calls sadeiparse, the text parser, to act on those files.

sadeiparse can also be run as a standalone if you already have the proper txt files.

command-line instructions are in comments at the top of both files.

Currently set for european elections.  Uncomment the non-european election version of temp files to scrape autonomic, congressional, and municipal elections.
